# Curriculum Vitae (C.V.)

Dr Richmond received his PhD degree (Flexible High Performance Agent Based Modelling on Graphics Card Hardware) in 2010 from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Sheffield (TUoS). During his PhD, he was awarded a Royal Academy of Engineering Student Development Fellowship in recognition of his commitment to public engagement. Post PhD he was immediately awarded a one-year EPSRC Doctoral Prize Fellowship. He subsequently secured industrial funding to work responsively with a requirements and development team to implement a software demonstration for decision making in emergency response evacuations.

As a research software engineer, Dr Richmond has developed software to support both GPUs and the SpiNNaker hardware systems. He publicly released the FLAME GPU software and proposed the SpineML simulator independent neural design language and associated graphical modelling tools (currently used in numerous EPSRC and EU funded research projects, and which form the basis of INCF NineML v2 language). In an interdisciplinary capacity, he received TUoS Crucible Seed Funding which he used to develop a robotic image processing platform (P.I.) and software to analyse the effect of bone disease caused by multiple myeloma (P.I.).  He was awarded an EPSRC Kick¬Start Grant for neural modelling software (C.I.), and a TUoS Early-Career Research Grant, for commercialisation of the FLAME GPU software for pedestrian simulation (P.I.). The latter project is currently under further development as a commercial tool by the Advanced Computing Research Centre (ACRC) at TUoS.

In February 2014, Dr Richmond was appointed as a Vice-Chancellor’s Fellow (VCF; 2.46% success rate) as part of the 'Leading Minds' campaign at TUoS. The aim of the VCF scheme is to appoint academics who will become future leaders. Dr Richmond is also an Academic Manager on a TUoS partnership, jointly funded by the Transport Systems Catapult and HEIFF. He secured TUoS Proof of Concept funding to progress his software for medical imaging (P.I.), and has BBSRC/National Science Foundation funding for 'the Digital Fruit Fly Brain' project (C.I.) to deliver an interdisciplinary software framework utilising GPU computing for simulating fruit fly brains.
