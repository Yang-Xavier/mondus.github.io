  abstract: "Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are a common approach to simulating biological systems. Multi-agent modelling provides a natural method for describing individual level behaviours of cells. However, the computation cost of simulating behaviours at an individual level is considerably larger than top down equation based modelling approaches. A recent possibility to improve computational performance is the use of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to provide the necessary parallel computing power. In this paper we show that multi-agent models describing biological systems at cellular level are well suited to GPU acceleration. Cellular level systems are characterised by vast numbers of agents that intensively communicate, indirectly through diffusion of chemical substances, or directly, through connection of chemical receptors. We present a study which utilises the FLAME GPU software to target a MAS model of a generic pathogen induced infection to validate the suitability of the GPU for simulation of a broader class of cellular level systems."

This paper demonstrates FLAME GPU as a suitable Agent Based Simulation environment for road network simulations, capable of coping with the increasing demands on road network simulation. Gipps’ car following model is implemented and used to demonstrate the performance of simulation as the problem size is scaled. The performance of message communication techniques has been evaluated to give insight into the impact of runtime generated data structures to improve agent communication performance. A custom visualisation is demonstrated for FLAME GPU simulations and the techniques used are described."

  abstract: "Simulation of complex systems provides a computational challenge due to the amount of computational performance required to simulate all individuals within a large population. The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) presents a potential solution. Using the CUDA programming language GPUs can be programmed for general purpose use. Unfortunately the translation of a complex systems model to CUDA code is a non-trivial task requiring specialist knowledge of the architecture to obtain good performance. This paper reviews FLAME GPU a framework which provides transparent mapping and simulation of complex systems models to a CUDA enabled GPU. The framework has considerable performance benefits over its CPU counterpart and provides real-time visualisation for interactive steering of simulations in domains as diverse as computational biology and pedestrian dynamics."

  abstract: "Agents within multi-agent simulation environments frequently compete for limited resources, requiring negotiation to resolve ‘conflict’. The negotiation process for resolving conflict often relies on a transactional or serial processes that complicates implementation within a parallel simulation framework. This paper demonstrates how transactional events to resolve competition can be implemented within a parallel simulation framework (FLAME GPU) as a series of iterative parallel agent functions. A sugarscape model where agents compete for space and a model requiring optimal assignment between two populations, the stable marriage problem, are demonstrated. The two case studies act as a building block for more general conflict resolution behaviours requiring negotiation between agents in a parallel simulation environment. Extensions to the FLAME GPU framework are described and performance results are provided to show scalability of the case studies on recent GPU hardware."

  abstract: "Ray tracing on parallel hardware has recently benefit from significant advances in the graphics hardware and associated software tools. Despite this, the SIMD nature of graphics card architectures is only able to perform well on groups of coherent rays which exhibit little in the way of divergence. This paper presents SpiNNaker, a massively parallel system based on low power ARM cores, as an architecture suitable for ray tracing applications. The asynchronous design allows us to demonstrate a linear performance increase with respect to the number of cores. The performance perWatt ratio achieved within the fixed point path tracing example presented is far greater than that of a multi-core CPU and similar to that of a GPU under optimal conditions."

  abstract: "Ability to simulate pedestrian behaviour on a large scale is essential in identifying potential dangers in public spaces during an evacuation. Multiple designs must be tested with varying parameters and run multiple times to achieve statistical significance due to the model's stochastic nature. In this short paper, we describe our prototype decision support tool that enables concurrent simulation on GPU-enabled computers by merging them to increase efficiency and dispatching simulation jobs across multiple machines on the network. Preliminary results with our GPU-optimised model have been shown to run at faster than real-time simulation speeds."

  abstract: "This chapter describes a number of key techniques that are used to implement a flexible agent-based modeling (ABM) framework entirely on the GPU in CUDA. Performance rates equaling or bettering that of high-performance computing (HPC) clusters can easily be achieved, with obvious cost-toperformance benefits. Massive population sizes can be simulated, far exceeding those that can be computed (in reasonable time constraints) within traditional ABM toolkits. The use of data parallel methods ensures that the techniques used within this chapter are applicable to emerging multicore and data parallel architectures that will continue to increase their level of parallelism to improve performance. The concept of a flexible architecture is built around the use of a neutral modeling language (XML) for agents. The technique of template-driven dynamic code generation specifically using XML template processing is also general enough to be effective in other domains seeking to solve the issue of portability and abstraction of modeling logic from simulation code.

  abstract: "We present a technique for simulating accurate physically modelled acoustics within an outdoor urban environment and a tool that presents the acoustics alongside a visually rendered counterpart. Acoustic modelling is achieved by using a mixture of simulating ray-traced specular sound wave reflections and applying radiosity to simulate diffuse reflections. Sound rendering is applied to the energy response of the acoustic modelling stage and is used to produce a number of binaural samples for playback with headphones. The visual tool which has been created unites the acoustic renderings with an accurate 3D representation of the virtual environment. As part of this tool an interpolation technique has been implemented allowing a user controlled walkthrough of the simulated environment. This produces better sound localisation effects than listening from a set number of static locations."

  abstract: "A large scale pedestrian simulation method, implemented with an agent based modelling paradigm, is presented within this paper. It allows rapid prototyping and real-time modifications, suitable for quick generation and testing of the viability of pedestrian movement in urban environments. The techniques described for pedestrian simulation make use of parallel processing through graphics card hardware allowing simulation scales to far exceed those of serial frameworks for agent based modelling. The simulation has been evaluated through benchmarking of the performances manipulating population size, navigation grid, and averaged simulation steps. The results demonstrate that this is a robust and scalable method for implementing pedestrian navigation behaviour. Furthermore an algorithm for generating smooth and realistic pedestrian navigation paths that works well in both small and large spaces is presented. An adaptive smoothing function has been utilised to optimise the path used by pedestrian agents to navigate around in a complex dynamic environment. Optimised and un-optimised vectors maps obtained by applying or not such function are compared, and the results show that the optimized path generates a more realistic flow."

  abstract: "High performance computing is essential for simulating complex problems using agent-based modelling (ABM). Researchers are hindered by complexities of porting models on parallel platforms and time taken to run large simulations on a single machine. This paper presents FLAME framework, the only supercomputing framework which automatically produces parallelisable code to execute on different parallel hardware architectures. FLAME’s inherent parallelism allows large number of agents to be simulated in less time than comparable simulation frameworks. The framework also handles the parallelisation of model code allowing modellers to run simulations on number of supported architectures. The framework has been well tested in various disciplines like biology and economics projects yielding successful research results like project EURACE, where the European economy was modelled using agents. More recently FLAME has been ported to consumer NVIDIA Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) allowing parallel performance equal to that of grid architectures with the ability to perform real time visualisation."

  abstract: "Cellular level agent based modelling is reliant on either sequential processing environments or expensive and largely unavailable PC grids. The GPU offers an alternative architecture for such systems, however the steep learning curve associated with the GPUs data parallel architecture has previously limited the uptake of this emerging technology. In this paper we demonstrate a template driven agent architecture which provides a mapping of XML model specifications and C language scripting to optimised Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) for the GPU. Our work is validated though the implementation of a Keratinocyte model using limited range message communication with non linear time simulation steps to resolve inter cellular forces. The performance gain achieved over existing modelling techniques reduces simulation times from hours to seconds. The improvement of simulation performance allows us to present a real time visualisation technique which was previously unobtainable."

  abstract: " Pedestrian simulations have recently focused on top-down implementations ignoring more computationally intensive agent based dynamics. This paper presents a framework for agent based modelling on the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) which demonstrates large scale pedestrian simulation and rendering. GPU hardware offers significant performance for dynamic large crowd simulations, however the process of mapping computational tasks to the GPU is not trivial and expert knowledge is required. An agent based specification technique is therefore presented, which allows the underlying GPU data storage and agent communication to be hidden. The framework allows the use of static maps to set static environment obstacles and a zoning technique is described for route planning. Parallel population feedback routines are also used to implement Level of Detail (LOD) rendering which avoids any costly CPU data read-back."
