# About the Course

Accelerator architectures are discrete processing units which supplement a base processor with the objective of providing advanced performance at lower energy cost. Performance is gained by a design which favours a high number of parallel compute cores at the expense of imposing significant software challenges. This module looks at accelerated computing from multi-core CPUs to GPU accelerators with many TFlops of theoretical performance. The module will give insight into how to write high performance code with specific emphasis on GPU programming with NVIDIA CUDA GPUs. A key aspect of the module will be understanding what the implications of program code are on the underlying hardware so that it can be optimised.
 
The modules aims, objectives and assessment details are available on the [modules public teaching page](http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/intranet/teaching/public/modules/level4/com4521.html).


# Assessment

## Assignmnet

The assignment makes up 80% of the total marks for this module and is split itot tow related parts. The handout will be available on MOLE from week 5 and week 9 and will be handed in in two stages.  

* Part 1 is due Tuesday 28th March (5pm) - Week 8
* Part 2 is due Wednesday 16th May (5pm) -  Week 12.

## MOLE Quizes

Two quizes, each 10% of the module mark will be held under exam conditions on 

* Monday the 6th March (16:00-17:00) - Week 5 (This is during the sencond half of the lecture, location to be confirmed)
* Tuesday the 25th April (9:00-10:00) - Week 9 (This will take place durin normal lab hours)


# Lecture Notes

Lectures will take place on Mondays 15:00 until 17:00 in Diamond lecture theatre DIA-LT09. In week 5 the second half of the lecture will be a MOLE quiz. Week 11 will be an invited lecture.

# Labs

Labs will take place on Tuesdays 9:00 until 10:50 in the Diamond High Spec Lab (DIA-206). Week 9 lab will be a MOLE quiz followed by assignment help. Week 11 (full lab) will be for assignment help. Assignment help will also be availble during any of the normal lab sessions. There will be no lab in week 12.

The lab register **must** be completed by every student following the completion and review of the exercises. You should complete this only when you have completed the lab **and** reviewed the solutions. You are not expected to complete this during the lab class but you should complete it by the end of the teaching week.
