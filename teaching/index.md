# Teaching

As part of my RSE Fellowship I am committed to teaching and advocating the use of GPU and accelerated computing. Currently I teach an undergraduate model [COM4521: Parallel Computing with GPUs](../COM4521). This course is aimed at undergraduates but is available to all research staff and students (subject to demand). 

If you are interested in more focused training then I run a series of short courses such as a one day [Introduction to CUDA course](./CUDA) (in partnership with CICS and ARCHER). The scope of this training will be expanded considerably over the next 5 years and if you have specific requirements or demands for training then please let [me know](../contact) and I will endeavour to deliver this for you.

If you are interested in doing a PhD with me or are interested in working with me as a Research Software Engineer or Research Assistant/Associate on a particular project then please check out my [available funded positions](./positions) or [contact me](../contact) directly to discuss other opportunities. For example I frequently propose summer placements for undergraduates interested in GPU computing, complex systems simulation or VR and Graphics.
