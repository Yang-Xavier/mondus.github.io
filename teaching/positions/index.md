# Full Time RA/RSE Positions

I have a fully funded 3-5 Year position available

### Research Associate/Research Software Engineer in Massive Scale Complex Systems Simulation with Accelerated Computing

A new position is available as a Research Associate/Research Software Engineer (at the University of Sheffield, UK) in the area of complex systems modelling using emerging high performance parallel architectures. 

This post can be configured in two different ways. Either as a 3 year Research Associate/Research Software Engineer only, or as a 5 year post working as a Research Associate/Research Software Engineer (60%) and a Research Software Consultant (40%). Candidateâ€™s preference for either option will be discussed at the interview stage. 

The overall goal of this post is to provide long-term software and development management for the FLAME and FLAME GPU packages that are used extensively within EPSRC-funded research. The post has the option to be extended from 3 - 5 years through research software consultancy via the newly formed Research Software Engineering Sheffield Initiative. The position would suit either a Software Developer with experience working in an academic environment, or a Researcher working in the area of application and implementation of software. In either case applicants should be excellent software developers with experience of writing performance oriented code in C or C++. An understanding of parallel computing techniques with some experience of accelerated computing with GPUs is essential and hands on experience of multi-core techniques and interdisciplinary research is highly desirable. A PhD in software engineering or computer science (or equivalent experience) is essential. 

The post holder will interface between software development and novel research into software approaches for simulation and, as such, there is scope and funding provided to disseminate via national and international conferences and workshops. Similarly, there is potential to collaborate with industry partners (e.g. Transport Systems Catapult, NVIDIA, EPCC, Archer, WRG/N8, Oxford eScience Centre, Intel/OCR). The post, therefore, would be well suited to a developer with excellent communication and engagement skills.

# PhD positions

I am continually seeking applications from talented and strongly motivated Software Engineers or Computer Scientists interested in studying for a Ph.D. with potential for high industrial and academic impact. The PhD topics are influenced by my role as a Research Software Engineer and have a string focus on delivering software to accelerate research in a range of domains. Any applications should be made directly through the university PhD application system
