# Multi Agent Visualisation and Interactive Rendering

Applications are invited for a PhD studentship starting in September 2016 (or beforehand). The candidate will join a growing team of researchers and research software engineers working in this area.

## Project Description

This Ph.D. project will focus on the problem of visualising large scale microsimulation models within interactive environments. The project is supported by the new government [Transport Systems Catapult](https://ts.catapult.org.uk/) who are able to provide important transport data, expertise, and access to start of the art Virtual Reality equipment including the [Omnideck 6](https://ts.catapult.org.uk/visualisation-laboratory) (a 360 degree treadmill). The Transport Systems Catapult is also linked with industrial partners including Highways England who have a vested interest in this research project. A significant aspect of the project will focus on the development of novel techniques to visualise systems of pedestrians and traffic within interactive environments using the Oculus Rift.

The project will be supervised by Dr Paul Richmond (Vice Chancellorâ€™s Research Fellow and EPSRC Research Software Engineering Fellow) and Dr Steve Maddock (Senior Lecturer) from the Virtual Reality, Graphics and Simulation research group in the Department of Computer Science.  The Department of Computer Science, within the Faculty of Engineering, was established in 1982 and has since attained an international reputation for its research and teaching. Currently there are over 100 members of staff in Computer Science, including 35 Academics. The Department has consistently rated highly in UK national research assessment exercises.  Further information about the Department can be found at [www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs](www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs).


## Candidate Profile

Candidates must have an excellent first degree in Computer Science, or a closely related subject, and have excellent programming skills. Prior experience of 3D computer graphics is essential and some experiance of GPU programming is highly desirable. Previous exposure to micro simulation modelling or complex systems simulation would be a distinct advantage, as is any previous experience of carrying out research.

## Funding 

This Studentship will cover tuition fees at the UK/EU rate and provide a tax-free stipend at the EPSRC rate for three years [https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/skills/students/help/minimumpay/](https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/skills/students/help/minimumpay/). 

## Application 

Applications should be submit via the [university application system](http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/postgraduate/research/apply/applying). Any enquiries should be directed towards [Dr Paul Richmond](../../../contact)
