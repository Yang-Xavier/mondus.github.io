The FLAME GPU Software originated from my PhD research but has been extended through a number of research projects and individual fellowships. It is also being developed by various researchers in [my team](../../profile/research) who are looking to improve various aspects of performance or functionality. The primary aim of FLAME GPU is to provide a high level abstraction for complex system simulation through agent based modelling. The details of the GPU architecture are hidden from an user and code is automatically generated. Performance levels of multi agent simulation in FLAME GPU can far exceed those of traditional multi agent simulators. Further details including downloads of the software are available on the [FLAME GPU website](http://www.flamegpu.com).

For details on FLAME for traditional CPUs and HPC visit [flame.ac.uk](http://www.flame.ac.uk). This software differs somewhat in the implementation but is based on the same idea of communicate state based agents. The FLAME GPU user guide provides details of differences and similarities. Funding has recently been secured to merge these two simulators into a unified simulation framework. Exciting times!
